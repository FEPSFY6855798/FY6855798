        This article is an insight into a range of developments in sustainable aviation, focusing on sustainable aviation fuels and briefly looking at
        electric-powered aircraft. Taking research from a range of books, articles, and projects, I will present to you both promising and innovative
        developments which are being used to both decarbonise aviation and increase its efficiency and affordability for people across the globe. 
        The aerospace Industry is currently one of the most dynamic and growing industries in engineering and this article aims to both educate and
        encourage readers to play their part in this worldwide fight against global warming.

        Aviation contributed to around 2% of carbon emissions in 2022. (European Union, 2023). Despite this, I personally believe that innovation is at
        an all-time high and that this dynamic industry will continue to develop and grow in efficiency as well as sustainability. I have no doubt that
        engineers will continue to innovate and help mitigate the potentially drastic impacts of global warming and climate change.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are currently one of the most promising solutions for making the aviation industry more environmentally 
responsible (European Union, 2023). For example, bio jet fuels. Aviation biofuels (usually referred to as bio jet or renewable jet fuel are 
liquid fuels that can be produced from a wide range of biomass including vegetable oils, plant materials, and animal waste 
(Imperial College London, 2017). Due to these biofuels being made from biomass that can replenish itself, they can be relied upon in the 
long-term unlike crude oils and coal which are currently being used up rapidly and will eventually run out due to them being finite resources. 

(Reyes García-Contreras, Jose A. Soriano, 2022)
“The most used fuels in aviation are Jet fuel (Jet A-1 or JP1A, kerosene), Kerosene-gasoline mixture (Jet B), Aviation gasoline (avgas) and 
Biokerosene. Most of these aviation fuels are based on fossil fuels and are therefore finite. However, there is increasing ongoing 
research to make them eco-friendly. Take Biokerosene for example, this fuel is a mixture of kerosene and biofuels and as a result 
it is still in the trial stage for use in different aircrafts. It is not completely fossil free and will still have some carbon 
footprint. However, with developments and advancements in carbon capture technology, biofuels could be widely adopted. The reasons 
are one they can be used with conventional systems, requiring minimal modification, and the other is that the carbon emissions given
out can be captured by the advanced carbon capture technologies. Hence, both performance and emission reduction (even net zero) are
guaranteed. An ideal, renewable substitute for these fuels would be hydrogen. However, to get to a point where hydrogen is commonly
used as an aviation fuel, an abundance of innovation and trial an error will be required in the years to come. Energy density, 
volume, safety, and other factors need to be proven. Liquified hydrogen has only 30% of the energy density of kerosene. Despite this, 
biofuel engineering still has a long way to go.”

        This segment will focus on Collins Aerospace, a company making extraordinary advancements in implementing electric power in aviation to not only reduce 
the carbon footprint of aviation but to also increase the speed and efficiency of flights. 
  
A brief list of their current objectives:
. Enabling hybrid-electric propulsion for more fuel-efficient flights.
. Creating lighter-weight, higher-performing structures to decrease maintenance.
. Reducing pilot workload with more autonomous operations.
. Driving forward more sustainable practices and products while accelerating advancements in technology and embracing digital transformation.
Collins Aerospace have both unique and exciting developments of electric motors. In 2022, they produced the first prototype 500KW electric motor for the 
Hybrid Air Vehicles’ Airlander 10 aircraft. 
(Collins Aerospace, 2024)
Airlander 10 is scheduled to begin hybrid-electric operation in 2026, followed by all-electric, zero-emission operation in 2030. To achieve this, the aircraft’s 
four fuel-burning engines will be replaced by Collins’ 500 kilowatt electric motors beginning with the two forward engines in 2026 and the two rear engines in 
2030. One fact that is commonly overlooked is that successful innovation in the aerospace industry will spill over into other closely linked industries such as
the automotive industry. More advanced electric motors could be implemented in electric cars for example, helping increase efficiency and the distance that can be 
covered before needing to be recharged.

“Over the last decade, we have invested $3 billion in advancing our electric architecture and dedicated more than 1,000 engineering resources to developing more 
electric systems. Add in 70+ years of experience and no one can match our financial commitment and expertise in this space.” This proves that Collins Aerospace 
are one of the world’s leaders in sustainable aviation and they will only continue to innovate and improve the sustainability of aviation.

Due to vast increases in innovation and efficiency, air travel continues to become more affordable and travel by flight is predicted to double by 2040 (Neste, 2024) 
and at the same time, global warming is never ceasing. Without swift action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, models project that holding global average 
temperatures to within a 1.5-2.0°C (2.7-3.6°F) increase may no longer be possible (UCAR, 2024). This calls for engineers across all industries to collaborate 
and innovate tirelessly to improve the quality of life for both this generation and generations to come. Despite the range of uncertainties it brings, the 
future looks extremely bright. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provides a key solution available today. It is a direct replacement for fossil jet fuel, made 
from renewable raw materials, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%* over the fuel’s life cycle compared to using fossil jet fuel. It is a safe 
and proven solution used in existing aircraft without the need for modifications” (Neste, 2024).This is concrete proof of how far sustainable engineering has 
come, and it will only get better. I see a future with advanced fuel cell and hydrogen technologies, SAFs and potentially all-electric aircraft becoming the norm.
